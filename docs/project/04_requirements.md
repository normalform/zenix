# üìå Requirements ‚Äì Zenix Emulator

This document defines the requirements of the Zenix MSX emulator at three structured levels:
- **User-Level Requirements (ULR)**: End-user goals and expectations
- **System-Level Requirements (SLR)**: Operational behaviors fulfilling ULRs
- **Component-Level Requirements (CLR)**: Detailed, testable implementation specs

## üßë‚Äçüíª User-Level Requirements (ULR)

| ID | Requirement |
|-----|-------------|
| ULR-01 | Load and run MSX1/2/2+ ROM and disk images. |
| ULR-02 | Provide accurate, real-time emulation with expected input/output behavior. |
| ULR-03 | Allow configuration of machine model, RAM size, slots, and devices. |
| ULR-04 | Offer optional debugging and internal state visibility tools. |
| ULR-05 | Export performance and runtime telemetry for observability. |
| ULR-06 | Support execution across desktop (CLI) and browser (WASM). |
| ULR-07 | Allow optional hardware acceleration via FPGA/ESP32 (non-mandatory). |

## ‚öôÔ∏è System-Level Requirements (SLR)

| ID | Requirement |
|-----|-------------|
| SLR-01 | Emulate the full Z80 instruction set with cycle accuracy. |
| SLR-02 | Support TMS9918A/V9938/V9958 video chips and modes (SCREEN 0‚Äì12). |
| SLR-03 | Emulate AY-3-8910 PSG audio and output via buffer. |
| SLR-04 | Load `.ROM` and `.DSK` images with model-appropriate behavior. |
| SLR-05 | Provide keyboard and gamepad input mapped to MSX I/O. |
| SLR-06 | Export OpenTelemetry spans and logs tagged by system/subsystem. |
| SLR-07 | Run at 60Hz frame timing on software-only execution. |
| SLR-08 | Load emulator settings via CLI flags or JSON file. |
| SLR-09 | Detect and optionally route emulation tasks to hardware accelerators. |

## üîß Component-Level Requirements (CLR)

| ID | Requirement |
|-----|-------------|
| CLR-01 | Z80 engine shall validate all 8-bit and 16-bit opcodes and flags. |
| CLR-02 | SlotMapper shall emulate 4-slot layout with configurable mappings. |
| CLR-03 | VDP core shall support VRAM access, palette registers, and line rendering. |
| CLR-04 | PSG core shall synthesize waveform data and buffer output at 44.1 kHz. |
| CLR-05 | Disk system shall emulate WD2793 controller with sector R/W. |
| CLR-06 | Frame renderer shall produce 60Hz stable video output. |
| CLR-07 | WASM output shall use `<canvas>` and Gamepad API in browser. |
| CLR-08 | Audio engine shall double-buffer PCM frames for smooth output. |
| CLR-09 | Input system shall scan key/gamepad states once per frame. |
| CLR-10 | FPGA detection logic shall enable fallback to software on failure. |
