# ⚠️ Risk Analysis with Mitigation Plan – Zenix Emulator

This document identifies key risks that may affect the Zenix project and provides corresponding mitigation strategies to reduce their likelihood or impact.

---

## 🧾 Risk Table

| ID | Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Category | Mitigation Strategy |
|----|------|------------|--------|----------|----------------------|
| R1 | Incorrect Z80 instruction emulation | Medium | High | Functional Accuracy | Use test ROMs (e.g., ZEXALL), implement unit tests for each opcode |
| R2 | Timing inaccuracy affecting compatibility | Medium | High | Performance/Timing | Maintain cycle-accurate timing; add telemetry to analyze execution cycles |
| R3 | WebAssembly build underperforms on low-end devices | High | Medium | Portability | Provide software toggle for rendering and audio; optimize memory use |
| R4 | FPGA offload introduces protocol instability | Low | Medium | Integration | Keep hardware offload optional; validate packet protocol separately |
| R5 | Gamepad or keyboard input delay in browser | Medium | Medium | UX | Debounce inputs and simulate polling buffers; profile event timing in Blazor |
| R6 | Incomplete VDP feature set (e.g., missing SCREEN modes) | Medium | Medium | Feature Coverage | Track implemented VDP features; add automated rendering test cases |
| R7 | Insufficient documentation slows adoption | Medium | Medium | Project Adoption | Maintain `/docs`; prioritize intro, use case, and architecture first |
| R8 | .NET version incompatibility or breakage | Low | Medium | Platform Dependency | Target LTS version; CI build matrix with future version checks |
| R9 | Poor audio quality or stuttering | Medium | High | UX / Output Fidelity | Buffer audio output frames; tune sample size and latency thresholds |
| R10 | Limited contributor onboarding | Medium | Medium | Community Growth | Provide a CONTRIBUTING.md and architecture diagrams early |

## 🛡️ Summary of Mitigation Strategies

- ✅ Maintain a robust **test suite** covering CPU, memory, and VDP behavior
- ✅ Include **OpenTelemetry** to help visualize performance bottlenecks
- ✅ Keep **FPGA offload modular and optional** by default
- ✅ Document project internals clearly for future contributors
- ✅ Profile **WebAssembly-specific input/render performance**
- ✅ Use **CI/CD** to detect build issues early and run compatibility tests

## 📌 Review Plan

- This risk list should be reviewed:
  - 📅 Monthly during active development
  - 📦 Before each major release or platform port
  - 🔁 After contributor feedback or new bug reports
