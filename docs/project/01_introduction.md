# ðŸ“˜ Introduction

## Project Name: Zenix â€“ MSX2+ Emulator

**Zenix** is a modern, open-source emulator for the MSX1, MSX2, and MSX2+ computer systems.  
It is designed with an emphasis on modularity, accuracy, and observability, while remaining accessible to users across platforms including desktop and the web.

This project aims to provide both an accurate MSX experience for retro computing enthusiasts and a transparent system for developers, educators, and emulator researchers.
